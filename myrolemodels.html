      <p>Choosing just a few role models is no easy task, as I have been blessed with the guidance and inspiration of many remarkable individuals. However, if I had to narrow it down to three, these would stand out above all.</p><br>
      
      <p><strong>First and foremost</strong> is the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam). He is my all-time favourite role model. In every aspect of his life—his character, patience, compassion, strength, humility—he exemplifies what it means to live with purpose and integrity. MashaAllah, he truly is a model for all of humanity.</p><br>

      <p><strong>The second</strong> is Shaykh Omar Suleiman. At one of the lowest points in my life, when my faith was wavering and I was close to giving up on myself, I came across one of his lectures. That moment was transformative. His words struck a chord deep within me and rekindled my connection to my faith. Even now, whenever he speaks, I find myself drawn in. His ability to speak to the soul continues to uplift and guide me.<br><br>

      <p><strong>Lastly, and most dearly,</strong> my mother. Words fail to capture just how amazing she is. Yes, many say their mothers are the best—but I truly believe mine is extraordinary. She is the strongest, most selfless, and patient woman I have ever known. Her heart is pure gold. She taught me that there is strength in crying, and that vulnerability is not a weakness, but a rare kind of courage. I love her deeply and aspire every day to make her proud<br><br>
