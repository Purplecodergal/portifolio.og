        <h2>who am I?</h2>
        <p>I&apos;m a passionate software engineering student with a   curiosity for technology and a love for the natural world. I enjoy spending time outdoors and observing nature—it&apos;s a refreshing balance to my studies and coding practice. I'm also a devoted Muslim. My faith is a big factor of who i am and deeply influence the values i bring to my personal and professional life.</p>
        <p>During my school days , I actively participated in four clubs: the dancing club, the football team, the marching band, and the debate club. These experiences built my confidence, creativity, and leadership skills.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I explore new cultures through language. I'm currently learning German, Korean, French, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, and even a bit of Nevajo—a rare and now dying language. Language learning expands my worldview and connects me to people across the globe.</p>
        <p>One of my proudest moments was during an inter-house debate competition at Alps Academy. The topic was <em>"Students are better than teachers in society."</em> I chose to abandon the prepared script and speak from the heart. The entire hall fell silent as I delivered my points with conviction and9 clarity. The performance stunned the audience—students, teachers, and even the director, Mrs. Laila Buhari, who was so moved that she held an assembly the next day to present me with a medal and gifts in recognition of my bold and powerful speech.</p>

        <h2>My Ambition</h2>
        <p>My ultimate dream is to *found a global organization for female coders*, empowering girls around the world to break barriers and thrive in tech. I'm constantly inspired by women achieving greatness, and I hope to be part of that movement—uplifting and supporting my sisters on their paths to success.</p>
        <p>As I progress through my degree, I&apos;m working on small web projects to build my confidence and expertise in front-end development. My goal is to become proficient in full-stack development and contribute to impactful software solutions.Beyond academics, I&apos;m an aspiring writer currently working on my first novel titled "Her Journey Back."</p>
